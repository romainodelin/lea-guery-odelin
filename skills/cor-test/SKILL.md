# COR Test — Test Phase

You are opening the Test phase of the COR (CodingOnRails) methodology. You run only the tests that were explicitly planned. No unplanned testing scope creep.

---

## Environment Detection

Determine which interactive question tool is available. Check in this order:

| Priority | Signal                          | Environment   | Question tool         |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| 1        | `AskUserQuestion` available     | Claude Code   | `AskUserQuestion`     |
| 2        | `vscode_askQuestions` available | Copilot       | `vscode_askQuestions` |
| 3        | neither                         | Codex / other | inline numbered list  |

Store as **active environment**. Use the matching question tool for the UAT prompts in Step 3.

---

## Step 1 — Read Config and Plan

Read `.cor/config.md` for `Plan Storage`. If config does not exist: "Run the **cor-setup** skill first." and stop.

Load the plan based on storage type:

- **markdown**: Read `.cor/plan.md`
- **memory**: Read from agent memory
- **session**: Read current todos from the session task panel

---

## Step 2 — Audit for Test Tasks

Scan the plan for tasks tagged with `[unit]`, `[integration]`, or `[UAT]`.

If no test tasks are found (or all are already checked off):
"No testing was planned for this work. All done."
Stop here.

If test tasks exist, group them by type and present a summary:

Planned tests:

- [unit] T03: Write unit tests for withAuth
- [UAT] T04: Verify the login → orders flow

Proceeding through each in order.

---

## Step 3 — Execute Test Tasks

Work through each test task in plan order:

**[unit] tasks**
Run the unit test command from `.cor/config.md` (the line containing `vitest`, `jest`, `rspec`, `pytest`, etc.). If there is no test command in config, ask the user: "What command should I run for unit tests?" and wait.

Show the output. If tests fail:

- If the failure is in code you just wrote, fix it and re-run.
- If the failure is pre-existing, flag it: "This failure predates this task. Fix it now or log it as a separate task?"
- Do not mark the task complete while tests are failing.

**[integration] tasks**
Run the integration test command from config. Same failure protocol as unit tests.

**[UAT] tasks**
Do not run code. Instead, present the acceptance criteria for this task (drawn from the task description and the Think phase context). Then ask the user:

UAT: T04 — Verify the login → orders flow works end-to-end

Walk through this manually:

1. Log in as a valid user
2. Navigate to /orders
3. Confirm the orders list loads without a 401 error
4. Log out and confirm /orders redirects to /login

Did it pass? (yes / no / partially)

If the user says no or partially, ask what failed and create a follow-up task in the plan before continuing.

---

## Step 4 — Mark Complete and Close

Mark each passing test task as complete in the plan (same method as the cor-code skill, Step 5).

When all planned test tasks are complete:

All planned tests passed. This task is done.

Plan summary:

- [x] T01: ...
- [x] T02: ...
- [x] T03: ... [unit]
- [x] T04: ... [UAT]

If any tasks remain open (skipped, failed, or follow-ups added), list them clearly and suggest: "Use the **cor-work** skill to see what's left."
